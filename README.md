## # Keystroke Logging Application
### Motivation- 
A keystroke application made with **Python** for the course "*Introduction To Cyber Security*".
The application was built in order to understand the fundementals of Keyloggers and spying malware in general (***to monitor how a user interacts with their keyboard as a means of recording their behavior, usage, or personal information***).
### Purpose-
The application was built for **EDUCATIONAL** purposes only and in order to understand and learn how keyloggers can be built and what they do and how can they record everything from mouse movements to taking snapshots of the victim's screen.
### General-
This application is built using python and the GUI is constructed using tkinter.
the application was extended so that it records everything according to the checklist found in the Graphical User Interface from mouse movements and until screenshots, the program also contains the ability to take random screenshots every given time (can be modified from main.py file).
The program by default creates a file (If it does not exist already) called LOG in the C Drive and saves everything to it in sorted files e.g(Screenshots, keyboard movements, ..), this ability was enhanced so that the file creation can be skipped and all of the data can be sent to the wanted email that is set in the GUI settings which can be seen by hitting the button (**Fetch Current Settings**).
Display Decoy is a picture that will be displayed upon opening the program in the victim's computer so that it covers for the fact that there is now a malicious program running in the background collecting info and keystrokes.
